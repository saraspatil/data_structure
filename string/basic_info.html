<p style='color:blue'>string</p>

• A string is a data type in python.
• String is sequence of characters which are enclosed within a single quote or double quote. 
  These characters could be anything like letters, numbers, or special symbols.
	For example, "python" is a string.
• A string is created by placing all the elements inside single ' ' or double '' ''  or triple ''' ''' quotes.
• The string type  is represented using a str class.
• String can be represented by using single ' ' or double '' ''  or triple ''' ''' quotes.
• We can create empty string using string constructor str() or single quote ' '.
• Ordered:- it preserves sequence order.
• Immutable:- String is immutable data type this means that element of string can not be changed once created.
• Duplicates:- duplicate elements are allowed in string.
• It support homogenous and heterogenous data. Eg. 'abcd' '1234'  'a1b2'
• It is global data type which accept everything.
• To get the length of string we have len() function.
• The background data structure of string is array. Hence indexing is but obvious.
## Indexing ##
	• Indexing is used for accessing single element.                                                                              there are two types of indexing                                                                                                             1) positive indexing :- positive indexing start from 0 to n-1.    
	For example, suppose we have a string s = 'python' and  if we want to access the 3rd element then need to use s[2] here we get 3rd element which is 't'.
	
        2) negative indexing:- negative indexing start from -n to -1.
	For example, suppose we have a string s = 'python' and  if we want to access the 3rd element then need to use s[-3] here we get 3rd element which is 't'.
	
	The index must be an integer. We can't use floats or other types, this will result 
	into TypeError.
	If we mention the index value greater than the length of a string then it will throw an index error.

       slicing

	• When we want access multiple elements in a sequence for this we have a slicing. Slicing is based on indexing only. We use : colon for slicing.                                                       
	Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.
	
	 Syntax:     [start index : stop index : step]
Eg. Suppose we have a string  s = 'python'  now here we can use slicing  s[2:5] then we got 'tho'.                                                                                                                                                       Ending index is excluded.                                                                                                                              If we want reverse string then we can use [start index : stop index: -1]
